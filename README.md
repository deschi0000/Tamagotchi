# Simple Command Line Tamagotchi

This is a simple command line tamagotchi program written using python for the Centennial Codehort Coding Challenge.

It is a turn-based version of the Japanese game which allows a player to care for their virtual pet through prompts and feedback, with some fun little animations thrown in as well. 

On a sunny day, the pet *should* be able to:

- [x] Be fed
- [x] Be put to bed
- [x] Lose health from hunger
- [x] Poop without prompting
- [x] Age from birth to death
- [x] Get sick from neglect

Early on in the process I had decided to make the animations a part of it, because of the original game's visual component. With each tweak, even in the final stages, came the inevitable bugs. If you find one, or have suggestions, let me know~ I want to get better!

I had a blast doing this project as it's one of the biggest I've undertaken so far. Thanks for checking it out folks!

The tamagotchi_app.exe file in the dist folder should do the trick. If not, feel free to grab the files and try it on your own!


## FAQ

#### Why are certain tamagotchi aspects disimilar from the original game?

Because I decided to go into this project as cold as possible, restricting myself to the limits of the challenge and the peripheral knowledge I had of the game (which I never owned). Any questions that I did have, I asked my wife, who told me what worked and what clearly wasn't a thing in the original game. I took this approach to limit copy-pasting as much as possible and try to challenge myself in problem-solving.

#### How does the tamagotchi's life progress?

It is a turn-based game, with each day divided into a morning, noon and night (and one day essentially being a year of a tamagotchi's life). I've set the Max age limit low, but feel free to change that depending on the type of gameplay you'd like. Regardless, your decisions will hopefully guide your pet to the very end of it's life where it will die peacefully of old age, or alternatively, suffer an early death where it will leave the temporal plane of the command line due to your neglect and miscare. I did set it on 'easy' mode, so there are plenty of safeguards to hint that it doesn't happen too early, but geez, just feed the thing.
