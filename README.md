# Simple Command Line Tamagotchi

This is a simple command line tamagotchi program written using python for the Centennial Codehort Coding Challenge.

It is a turn-based version of the Japanese game which allows a player to care for their virtual pet through prompts and feedback, with some fun little animations thrown in as well. 

On a sunny day, the pet *should* be able to:

- [x] Be fed
- [x] Be put to bed
- [x] Lose health from hunger
- [x] Poop without prompting
- [x] Age from birth to death
- [x] Get sick from neglect

Early on in the process I had decided to make the animations a part of it, because of the original games visual aspect. 

With each tweak, even in the final stages, came the inevitable bugs. If you find one, or have suggestions, let me know! I want to get better!

I had a blast doing this project as it's one of the biggest I've undertaken so far. Thanks for checking it out folks!

## How to use

The tamagotchi_app.exe file in the dist folder should do the trick. If not, feel free to grab the files and try it on your own!


## FAQ

#### Why are certain tamagotchi aspects disimilar from the original game?

Because I decided to go into this project as cold as possible, restricting myself to the limits of the challenge and the peripheral knowledge I had of the game (which I never ownded). Any questions that I did have, I asked my wife, who told me what worked and what clearly wasn't a thing in the original game. I took this approach to limit copy-pasting as much as possible and try to challenge myself in problem-solving.

#### Is it turn-based?

Each day is divided into a morning, noon and night with one day essentially being a year of a tamagotchi's life. Depending on what the limit is set to, the decisions taken will your pet may make it happily all the way to the end and die peacefully of old age, or, likewise, early from neglect and miscare. The game does try to hint so it doesn't happen, but geez, just feed the thing.
